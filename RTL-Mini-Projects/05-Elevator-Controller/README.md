This module introduces the three major physical design metrics: Power, Performance, and Area (PPA). It explains how these metrics influence digital IC design and how they are balanced during ASIC implementation.

The module also introduces PPA tradeoffs and RTL-level PPA optimization techniques that help improve design efficiency while maintaining required functionality and timing.

## 🛠️ Core Concepts Covered

### 1. Power

Understand power consumption as a major constraint in modern digital IC design.

Key concepts include:

- Dynamic power
- Static power
- Switching activity
- Capacitance
- Supply voltage
- Leakage power
- Clock power

Power optimization is important for reducing energy consumption, thermal effects, and overall system power requirements.

### 2. Performance

Understand performance in terms of how quickly a digital circuit can operate while satisfying its timing requirements.

Important concepts include:

- Clock frequency
- Clock period
- Propagation delay
- Critical path
- Setup timing
- Timing slack
- Maximum operating frequency

Performance optimization focuses on reducing critical-path delay and improving timing margins.

### 3. Area

Understand area as the amount of silicon resources required to implement a digital design.

Area can be influenced by:

- Number of logic gates
- Number of flip-flops
- Standard-cell selection
- Memory and macro resources
- Interconnect
- Design architecture

Reducing unnecessary hardware can help improve area efficiency.

### 4. PPA Tradeoffs

Understand that Power, Performance, and Area are interconnected design metrics.

Improving one metric may negatively affect another.

Typical tradeoffs include:

- Higher performance may require larger or faster cells.
- Larger cells can increase area and power.
- Lower power may require architectural or frequency changes.
- Area optimization can sometimes affect timing.
- Timing optimization can increase power and area.

Therefore, PPA optimization requires balancing multiple design objectives.

### 5. RTL-Level PPA Optimization

Understand how RTL coding and architecture decisions can influence the synthesized implementation.

Important techniques include:

- Removing unnecessary logic
- Reducing redundant hardware
- Optimizing arithmetic operations
- Efficient resource sharing
- Reducing switching activity
- Optimizing datapath width
- Improving FSM implementation
- Reducing unnecessary registers
- Clock-enable based optimization

### 6. Power Optimization

Understand how RTL and architectural decisions can reduce unnecessary switching and power consumption.

Common approaches include:

- Reducing switching activity
- Avoiding unnecessary computations
- Reducing unnecessary signal transitions
- Optimizing clock-related logic
- Using efficient control logic

### 7. Performance Optimization

Understand how RTL structure can affect critical-path timing.

Important approaches include:

- Reducing combinational depth
- Optimizing critical paths
- Balancing datapaths
- Reducing unnecessary logic levels
- Improving arithmetic implementation
- Supporting efficient synthesis

### 8. Area Optimization

Understand how RTL structure can influence the amount of synthesized hardware.

Common approaches include:

- Removing redundant logic
- Reducing data widths where appropriate
- Sharing hardware resources
- Simplifying Boolean logic
- Avoiding unnecessary registers
- Optimizing FSM and control structures

### 9. PPA and ASIC Design Flow

Understand that PPA is evaluated throughout the ASIC design flow rather than at only one stage.

PPA considerations are relevant during:

- RTL design
- Logic synthesis
- Floorplanning
- Placement
- Clock Tree Synthesis
- Routing
- Static Timing Analysis

RTL-level decisions can therefore have significant downstream effects on physical implementation.

### 10. PPA Optimization Mindset

Develop the ability to evaluate an RTL implementation not only by functional correctness but also by its implementation cost.

A good RTL design should aim to satisfy:

**Functionality + Timing + Power + Area**

The objective is to achieve the required performance with acceptable power consumption and silicon area.
